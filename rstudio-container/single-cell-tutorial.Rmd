```{r}
# Load the PBMC dataset
pbmc.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "/data/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/")
# Initialize the Seurat object with the raw (non-normalized data).

```

```{r}
# FeatureScatter is typically used to visualize feature-feature relationships, but can be used
# for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in object metadata, PC scores etc.

plot2 <- FeatureScatter(pbmc, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "nFeature_RNA")
